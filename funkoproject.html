      <div class="question">
        <strong><em>What is Funko?</em></strong>
        <span class="info">
          Comparable to figurines, Funko Pop vinyl figures are based on icons,
          popular culture, comic books, video games, and movies.
          <br />

          These toys with nostalgic themes come with gigantic heads and eyes,
          portraying well-known licensed characters from many franchises in a
          variety of sizes, clothing, stances, and finishes.
          <br />

          In addition, Funko Pop merchandise is packaged in a stylish display
          box, which makes it the perfect collection for fans of pop culture
          enthusiasts, from movies to icons. Therefore, Funko's Pop range
          provides something for everyone, regardless of their interests!

      <h2>Value of Collections</h2>
      <p>
        Collecting Funko Pops can generate value over time which is why it is a
        very popular hobby. Funkos when they first vocme out can range from $13
        to $70 and can possible stay at that value, however with time, demand,
        and rarity; the value can jump. The rarest Pop can be valued around
        $10k! There are some that reach over $100k, however you don't see them
        as often. Nonetheless, Pops' worth fluctuates from time to time, thus
        collecting the rarest design has a higher chance of appreciating in
        value over time.
